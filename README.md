# HabitTrack
## Ninth project in ABND course
The goal was to design and create the structure of a Habit Tracking app which would allow a user to store and track their habits over time. This project did not have any UI components, but focuses on how to design and implement a simple database.

## Project overview
- Creating a SQLite table in your app
- Populating that table with new entries
- Modifying the entries
- Displaying the contents of the table to users.

## Project requirements
- Setting up and using the database schema for a simple habit tracking app. 
- Defining and setting up up the database schema (i.e. table and columns) that can be used to help a user keep track of their habits (e.g. walking the dog, practicing the saxophone, taking any medications). 
- Creating 2 methods that insert and read data to/from your database. These 2 methods can all be contained in a single Java file.
