# HabitTrack
The goal is to design and create the structure of a Habit Tracking app which would allow a user to store and track their habits over time. This project will not have any UI components; instead, you will focus on what happens behind the scenes, practicing how to design and implement a simple database.
Creating a SQLite table in your app
Populating that table with new entries
Modifying the entries
Displaying the contents of the table to users.


For this project, youâ€™ll be setting up and using the database schema for a simple habit tracking app. This project will not have any UI components; instead, you will focus on what happens behind the scenes, practicing how to design and implement a simple database.

First, define and setup up the database schema (i.e. table and columns) that can be used to help a user keep track of their habits (e.g. walking the dog, practicing the saxophone, taking any medications). Then, create 2 methods that insert and read data to/from your database. These 2 methods can all be contained in a single Java file.
