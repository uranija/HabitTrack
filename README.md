# HabitTrack
The goal is to design and create the structure of a Habit Tracking app which would allow a user to store and track their habits over time. This project will not have any UI components; instead, you will focus on what happens behind the scenes, practicing how to design and implement a simple database.
Creating a SQLite table in your app
Populating that table with new entries
Modifying the entries
Displaying the contents of the table to users.
